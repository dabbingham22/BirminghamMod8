## Description
This command-line app lets you create and interact with vehicles. You can either make a new one or pick from existing ones. When creating a vehicle, you’ll choose between a car, truck, or motorbike and enter details like make, model, and year. Once it’s set up, you can start using it right away. If you go with an existing vehicle, you can jump straight into performing actions. The app lets you do different things with your vehicle, and you’ll see the results right in the command line. You can keep going with more actions for as long as you want or exit whenever you're done.
